# OpenCV-Experiments
A collection of works I've created using the python library OpenCV

Works include splitting images into their colour channels for image processing, chromakey of still images and background removal of video with object detection.
These were completed in 2023 as part of a course on Computer Vision during my Masters

To Run:
Colour Channels
python colour-channels.py -[colourprofile] [img_path]

Chromakey
python chromakey.py [background_img_path] [greenscreen_img_path] 

Backgroung Removal
python bgr.py [video_path]
